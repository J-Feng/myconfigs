myconfigs
=========
An out-of-box config set.

These are simplified configurations based on [my dot files](https://github.com/J-Feng/mydotfiles), which makes some configs to be used when
internet can not be accessed easily or I need to use them imediatly without compiling or other complex dependencies.

Now only Vim config is added.
* Don not use vundle for plugins' management
* Remove or replace plugins that need external dependences
* Add precompiled tools, such as ctags and cscope, for Windows
